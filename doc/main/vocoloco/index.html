          <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
          <p>VocoLoco was conceptualized to be a group messaging application that would allow users to record and send audio files as well as text messages to other users. The other innovative component to the application is that a user is able to see who was the last to send a message through an intuitive home screen which shows all the users in a conversation and orders them based on who last posted a message.</p>

          <h2>UNDERSTANDING THE QML</h2>         
          <p>Unfortuately there does not seem to be any automated documentation solution for QML yet. I did however try to conform to some consistent, in-line, documentation and comment styles. In each QML file, the properties are defined at the top and are typically the first thing in the file. Then the visual markup is the body of the file with comments throughout and finally, at the bottom of each file are the functions that pretain to that file with comments above them describing their use and purpose.

          <br></br>
          <p>The home screen allows users to immediately see who has posted a new message in their conversations by highlighting the users image when that user has posted a message that hasn't been read yet.</p>

          <p>Messages will change their layout based on if the message was sent from the current user or from someone else. We were able to implement playing audio files, and when a user sends an audio file it will appear with the play button which the user can push to hear the audio file.</p>

            <h3>Patrick Burd</h3>
              <p>Pat created everything in the LocoServer directory. He created the entire server that the application uses. He also implemented audio control features through calling native android (java) methods through the JNI from within Qt (c++). </p>
            <h3>Michael Cueno</h3>
              <p>Mike created everything in the VocoLoco directory. He created the entire client for the android operating system using QML and c++ (with the exception of the JNI/AndroidMediaObject files made by Pat)</p>
            <h3>Alex OOmen</h3>
              <p>Alex created the logo for the application</p>

          <h2>SHORTCOMMINGS</h2>
          <p>With significant effort, we were not able to implement the storing of recorded audio files on the android phone. It required the use of the JNI and instantiating a MediaRecorder in the native code on the android device from within Qt's framework. This gave us very little debugging information and ultimately stopped us from reaching the project goal of sending voice messages across a group message application. We were able to implement the playing of audio files however. In this case the audio files were given in xml as a url, downloaded to the phone and played in the JNI with a MediaPlayer object. Even though this last piece didn't fall into place, we feel that we still have a competent application and a fulfilling project. Created, by hand the components needed to send and receive messages from one android device to another in real time.</p>

          <p>This project uses SearchBox.qml and ScrollBar.qml, both of which are example qml files found in Qt Quick documentation and tutorials. More information and copyright information is included in the file comment headers of these files.
