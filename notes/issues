o Bug in android on login, segmentation fault in passing reply between functions 

  Attempt one: Store reply in a temporary QByteArray or a QList<QByteArray (for the headers)
    that is defined in HttpManager and use this to pass information between functions

    Failed: Doesn't work because reply has no data until it sends the isFinished signal, this signal 
      must be connected to another method that handles parsing the reply, but this is again passing the 
      reply to another function. 

    Attempted fix: instead of using isFinished signal, try to pause the system until reply has finished
      
      Attempt one: use a while (true) { if (reply.isFinsihed) break; }. 
           
            - This failed, caused an infinite loop..


  Proposed solution: write an HttpManager that inherits QNetworkManager and reqwrite the get methods... (Hard)

  Proposed solution: Look into authenticator.
